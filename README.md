# TenTen16

Tenten16 is a fairly simple Jekyll generated site. This project got its start as a follow along from the [{devtips}](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners) youtube channel and [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJhhLvW-Xvg&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A) playlist. Thanks Travis Neilson!

The two main reasons for this project are:
1. To learn new things & have a website/blog without having to use Wordpress or some other CMS


  * Which lead to things like
    * Git
    * Static site generation
    * SASS
    * Jade
    * Javascript
    * markdown
    * Some liquid
    * working in command line


2. Because I'm getting married and we needed/wanted a website for that.


What I wanted was a flexible site that was easy to create and maintain and did not require a data base. Also a site that I could host for next to nothing with a custom url. Now you could say that this was not the easiest approach and you may be right but I believe that if you are reading this you are smart enough to get it done. I'm a commercial roofer who knew just enough to use google and youtube and I got it done. I owe much to the above mentioned for anything here that could be considered a success.
