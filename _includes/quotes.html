          When I first met Ron I’d say I was pretty ambivalent. It all started at a party with a small group of mutual friends. He didn’t seem too friendly, so after about 30 minutes of trying my very hardest to be extra jovial & outgoing (not easy for someone as introverted and socially awkward as I am), I thought to myself, “Hmmm, I wonder what's with this dude… he’s talking to everyone but me, and I'm even making an effort right now. How rude.” Our groups parted ways for a couple of hours and reconvened at a house party. I walked in the door and looked up to see Ron walking fiercely into the room, his arms spread like wings, yelling, “There you are!” I looked behind me and prepared to get out of the way, only to find myself being launched at and captured by the biggest bear hug from this guy who I didn't even recognize from just hours before. That was my first exposure to how Ron breaks the ice, and it worked. We didn't stop talking for the rest of the evening. It was later revealed that he schemed to get my phone number, and he messaged me the next day to ask me out for a proper date. After ruminating for hours and hours, I decided to break out of my vigilance for a moment and go for it. Turns out that was the best decision of my life (besides saying “yes”).

          I met Portia at a pre-party gathering of some mutual friends. When she first came in there was a palpable change in the energy of the room. Everyone's attention was focused on her and she seemed content to have it that way. I'm fairly introverted and just the sort to ignore an attention seeker. She seemed like a pretentious attention whore to me, so true to my nature I pretty much ignored her. After watching a while and talking to others a bit I realized that I was off base with my original assessment. Oh crap I thought. I blew it! This woman is fun and smart and beautiful and I, well I wasn't exactly presenting my best self... So I angled a bit to be in a better position when we were all going to be at a Halloween party later. I'm not sure how well I did but when she showed up at the party I latched on to her and never looked back. The next day I asked her on an official date. She agreed and I was pumped! She had baked me cookies that she gave me on our first date and that was that. I was totally hooked. Make no mistake though, I had to give chase, which is something I never bother to do. Doing so was absolutely worth it. One of the best decisions I've ever made!
